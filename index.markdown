I'm a starting PhD student at the [distributed computing group](https://disco.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich. I did my undergraduate and master's studies at the University of Edinburgh, with an exchange at the University of Pennsylvania.

My current research interests include:
 
- coarsened sparsity in neural network architectures
- un/self/semi-supervised learning on nanoscale systems
- theoretical limitations of graph neural networks
