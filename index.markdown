I'm a starting PhD student at the [distributed computing group](https://disco.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich. I did my undergraduate and master's studies at the University of Edinburgh, with an exchange at the University of Pennsylvania.

My current research interests include (as of January 2025):
 
- transformer token merging
- LLM forecasting
- interpreting sequence-to-sequence models as distributed systems
